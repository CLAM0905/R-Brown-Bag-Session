# Brown Bag given to data science cohort 

## This is a three part overview of how to effectively look at 2020 Census data within R/RStudio

    1. Exploring your data with simple commands

    2. Manipulate and transform with the tidyverse: intro to dplyr commands using select, rename, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, and group_by

      + Select: select will allow us to keep the columns we need for our analysis
      +  Rename: rename will allow us to turn the names into something easier to work with. R does not like spaces so this allows us to make them shorter, more intuitive names
      +  Filter: filter will allow us to keep rows that meet certain conditions
      +  Arrange: arrange will sort our data based on the designated column. 
      +  Mutate: mutate will allow us to use a calculation or logic to create a new column 
      +  Summarise: summarize will allow us to aggregate data by mean, median, and several other calculations 
      +  Group by: group_by will allow us to summarise our data by grouping variables, such as type or size
